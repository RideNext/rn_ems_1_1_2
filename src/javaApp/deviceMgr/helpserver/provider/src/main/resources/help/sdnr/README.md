# SDN controller for 'Radio' (SDN-R)

SDN-R adds features and functionality to the OpenDaylight-based controller 'CCSDK/SDNC'. It is built on the Common Controller Framework to control and manage wireless resources. Wireless resources are virtual network functions (e.g. vBBU, vEPC) or physical network functions (e.g. microwave and millimeter wave radios, eNodeB, RRH, DAS equipment).
